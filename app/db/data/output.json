    "pageContent": "# Adventurers\n\nAdventurers is a new type of ERC721 contract that is upgradeable and composable on StarkNet. Adventurers are free to mint, and with StarkNet’s very competitive transaction fees they are as free to play as it gets on-chain. Adventurers are the key to playing many games in the Realmverse and are a crucial element of the economy.\n\n### How is an Adventurer Born?\n\nAdventurers will be claimed directly on StarkNet for substantially lower mint fees. Once an Adventurer is claimed, the player will be able to equip Loot items that have been distilled from the [Loot Fountain](./loot-fountains.md). Adventurers will be able to be traded like any other NFT.\n\n### The Genetics\n\nWhen the Adventurer is selected you will be able to select their race and sex. These will be written on-chain permanently.\n\n\n### The Statistics\n\nAdventurers all start with a base layer of statistics. These statistics level up as time goes by depending on the types of activity the Adventurer completes. The modular architecture of the Adventurer contract will allow for new statistics and new activities (both from within Realms and the wider ecosystem) to be added over time.\n\n\n---\n\n## What do you do with an Adventurer?\n\n### Questing\n\nOnce the Adventurer is equipped they will be able to quest in various parts of the map. This will include both active and passive activities. These activities will yield resources and other special items which the Adventurer can use to craft.\n\n### Crafting\n\nA key component of the Realmverse is crafting, and anyone with an Adventurer is eligible for it. This is the topic of the next section - [Loot Fountains](./loot-fountains.md).\n\n### Interoperability with new modules\n\nThe open nature of the protocol allows new developers to build experiences for the Adventurers, so the possible utility for the Adventurers is limited only by the imagination of developers.\n\n",

    "pageContent": "# Inflation: Loot Fountains\n\n💡 Layer 1 = Data Layer\n\n💡 Layer 2 = Computation\n\nFor Loot to realize its potential as a high-value game asset it needs to be more dynamic and available to more people. We have taken the approach of an inflationary distillation contract which splits each Loot bag into its individual items. Each item is then available on StarkNet to trade and play with. Balance this contract with controlled inflation mechanics and we can open Loot to the next 100k players.\n\n### Controlled inflation is good\n\nInflation is a natural phenomenon in the world as more energy is injected into ecosystems. Loot is no different. There are 8,000 Loot bags with a total of 64,000 items.\n\nThis process would look something like this:\n\n![Loot Distillation](/img/game/loot-distilation.png)\n\n---\n\n### Item Flow\n\n1. Items are distilled into individual ERC721s directly onto StarkNet in the holder's account\n2. Items are available to trade, use in games, or equip on an Adventurer\n\n### Inflation Rate\n\nThe actual inflation rate will be finalized on a vote by the hybrid DAO, however, our proposal is as follows:\n\n- 1 Distil event per 604,800s (1 Week)\n- 25 $LORDS to distil a bag\n\nIf 2,000 bags are distilled each week, this will equate to ~16,000 items which allow the equipping of potentially 2,000 Adventurers. Although it is highly doubtful that all 2000 would be assembled.\n\n### Item Statistics\n\nEach item will have its own set of dynamic statistics that will evolve with usage.\n\n### Equipping Items\n\nAdventurers will be able to equip these items in any combination that suits them best.\n\n### Trading\n\nAll the Loot items will be traded on the NFT Marketplace and will be priced in ETH.\n\n### Dropping of Items\n\nIn the Lootverse there will be various places to explore. Some of these places will be more dangerous than others. If a traveller is not careful they may drop their items and never recover them...\n\n### The Merchant Contract\n\nA merchant will be a buy-back contract where users can go to burn their unwanted items. In exchange for the burn, the players will receive a combination of resources and or $LORDS back. This will aim to provide a lever to control the supply of items into the marketplace. The specifics of this will be explained closer to launch.\n",

Once this game is thriving, the methodologies learned will be applied to the next eternal game with the long term goal of becoming the cornerstone development house for building on-chain games.\n\n---\n\n### The Team\n\nWe are a passionate team of:\n- Web3 natives\n- .cairo developers\n- Frontier pushers\n- Full-stack developers\n- Designers and storytellers\n- Gamers and game designers\n- Hackathon Winners (*StarkNet Hackathon)\n\nCurrently the core team consists of 12 members, but this will continue to grow as we on-board more talent into the core.\n\n---\n### Funding/Treasury\n\n**Treasury**\n\nThe treasury is currently funded by royalties on secondary sales of Realms ([OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/lootrealms) & [LooksRare](https://looksrare.org/collections/0x7AFe30cB3E53dba6801aa0EA647A0EcEA7cBe18d)).\n\nThe Bibliotheca DAO treasury can be found here: https://treasury.bibliothecadao.xyz/\n\n**Grants into the DAO**\n\nThe DAO has received multiple grants from within the Lootverse and beyond:\n- Loot DAO\n- GitCoin\n- StarkWare\n\n---\n### Our Governance\n\nGovernance of the DAO is based around the Realms NFTs, however this will be expanded in the future.\n\n### Open source\n\nAll code within this ecosystem is open source. Players are free to fork and tweak the game as they see fit; the value of the ecosytem comes not from constraining the code, but setting it free. It is no secret as to why Linux is the most used operating system in the world; it's because of its open source nature. Anyone is free to build on Linux, and anyone is free to build and extend the Realms and Bibliotheca ecosystem. See our [Github](https://github.com/BibliothecaForAdventurers/).\n\n### cc0 - no copyright reserved\n\nUnrestricted IP unlocks unexpected creativity. Building in the public invites the weird and curious to build on your creative base. Loot unlocked an open source world build which we are all still building on, and we are pushing this forward in an open gaming world. All assets within this world are CC0 and free for anyone to build on.\n\n",

From the outset of this project we have always strived to be as decentralized as possible, and the project is a example of this. We are governed by a fair release of Realms, and the Core team is shepherding the first versions of the games we are building. \n\nHowever, we are building something greater than just a game; we are building an open gaming protocol which anyone can build ontop of. This gaming protocol should not be controlled by any single entity or ‘Team’ it should be built and maintained by *many* entities. The Core team still has a lot of work to do before the protocol is ready, but our long term aspirations is to build *on* the protocol, *not control it*. \n\nIt is the Core teams responsibility to deliver the short term goals, but is the entire DAOs mission to deliver the long term goals.\n\n## What is Bibliotheca DAO?\n\n> “A decentralized game studio, incubator and research lab for on-chain games.”\n\n## Bibliotheca DAO should always\n\n- Stay fully decentralized and not be controlled by any single legal entity\n- Fund and nurture projects building in the ecosystem\n- Be a place where bleeding edge technology is discussed and built\n- Deliver open source, cc0 projects and code\n- Be maintainer of Adventurers play to die (P2D) gaming protocol\n\n## Short term mission\n\n- Deliver first production version of Eternum\n- Deliver first version of the Adventurers gaming protocol\n- V1 tooling to build on-chain games on the Adventures protocol\n- Deliver the AMM\n- Deliver order book NFT market\n- Deliver NFT AMM\n\n## Long term mission\n- Incubate on-chain games / media that exist in the universe\n- Govern the open gaming protocol\n- Self sufficient through protocol fees / LP\n- Industry leading research lab incubator for on-chain games\n- Build and maintain robust infrastructure to encourage centralized entities to build on the protocol\n\n## The core responsibilities Bibliotheca DAO\n- Building, maintaining and balancing the macroeconomic factors of the ecosystem. This includes distribution of Lords and resources and its subcomponents (i.e Realm population and its impact on resource production) and the AMM\n- The distillation of Loot items and adventurer creation modules, and the physics layer of equipping items and statistics\n- The maintenance of the first game in the ecosystem (Eternum) providing a layer of locational physics and army building\n- The item crafting engine\n- Player education and marketing\n- Maintaining the Adventurers tooling and contracts\n- Most importantly - to guide the path towards a thriving decentralized ecosystem building on top of the established Realms/Biblio primitives, ensuring an eternal community - not just eternal code\n- Technical advice and development tooling for teams building in the ecosystem (e.g token sink design and on-chain game loops), and the decision making process behind shared incentives and grants\n",

The Nexus is an all-seeing, omniscient machine that keeps the Realmverse at equilibrium.\n\nFor generations, Adventurers have scaled the Citadel mountain peak to pay tribute to the Nexus and contribute $LORDS to fuel the machine. These brave and generous Adventurers are rewarded with excess runoff from the network in the form of $LORDS.\n\n---\n\n## Sustainable single-sided staking\n\nWeb3 is Read, Write, Own. Bibliotheca DAO’s vision from inception was to have the players own the gaming protocol and actively contribute to the direction and metagame.\n\nUp until the time of writing, $LORDS emissions have only been emitted either by staking your Realm or by providing liquidity to the Uniswap pair. This initial structure was intended to reward Lords who invested in the early days of the project with high yields for a short period of time. As planned the rewards are switching now to a sustainable long-term model.\n\nBelow we outline our vision for a sustainable, non-inflationary single-sided staking mechanism, which allows players the opportunity to contribute to the growth of the protocol and be rewarded for doing so.\n\n\n\n### The $LORDS must flow\n\n$LORDS will be emitted via a TBC system that will reward activity and engagement in the game. These are set at 25 per day/victory and decrease slowly overtime to balance inflation with growth, with the total distribution taking a minimum of 7 years. \n\nAs a holder, you have to make a choice where to store your $LORDS which are outlined below.\n\n---\n\n![$LORDS tokenomics](/img/game/lords-tokenomics.png)\n\n---\n\n\n## The Nexus\n\nTransactions within the protocol rely on trading with $LORDS. And with these transactions comes a fee (to power the Nexus). These fees are currently set at the following %, however, as with any decentralized protocol, governance can vote to alter these.\n\n| Action | Fee |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| AMM (Automatic Merchant) | 1.5% |\n| In-game items | 100% |\n\n### Where do the $LORDS fees go? \n\nThe fees flow into a splitter account which manages the % between the Nexus and the Bibliotheca DAO Treasury. The division % is still to be determined and will be adjusted via a DAO vote.\n\n*Note: all mainnet fees (eg OpenSea, LooksRare etc) will be sent to the mainnet Bibliotheca DAO multi-sig.*\n\n---\n\n### The Nexus Rewards\n\n*Players have two options to choose from, or can choose both:*\n\nimport Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\nimport TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n\n<Tabs>\n  <TabItem value=\"1. $LORDS Offering (single-sided $LORDS staking)\" label=\"1. $LORDS Offering (single-sided $LORDS staking)\" default>\n\nThe $LORDS are offered to the Nexus and in return receive run-off from the network's overflow.\n\n### How does it work?\n\nPlayers will stake their $LORDS in the Nexus and be rewarded per block according to the previous 24hr trading period. Your reward is calculated according to your share of the offerings.\n\n\n![The Nexus](/img/game/nexus-single-sided.png)  \n\n</TabItem>\n  <TabItem value=\"2.

The design of it may change from this current iteration as StarkNet evolves and the needs for the protocol evolves.\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Primary economic trade\n\nThe primary economic trading mechanism within the Realmverse is the Resources AMM (Automatic Market Maker). This is a decentralized marketplace where players provide resources and $LORDS pairs and are rewarded for doing so. By providing assets to the market a thriving economy emerges where players can trade instantly. \n\nThis is an ERC1155 (resources token type) & ERC20 ($LORDS token type) Automatic Market Maker & the first of its kind running on StarkNet. It is based on the Solidity AMM, [NiftySwap](https://github.com/0xsequence/niftyswap/blob/master/src/contracts/exchange/NiftyswapExchange20.sol). \n\n\n\n[See the full code here](https://github.com/BibliothecaForAdventurers/realms-contracts/tree/main/contracts/exchange)\n\n---\n\n## How does trading work on the AMM?\n\nWhen making a swap, the exchange will calculate the price according to the x * y = k curve. Fees are collected against the currency in both buy and sell actions. Due to this, k will steadily increase as a measure to collect rewards for the liquidity providers.\n\n### Multi-resource swaps\n\nThe key difference between the resource AMM and traditional AMMs (Uniswap) is that it allows multi-swapping of tokens. Meaning, that you can achieve the following:\n\n```\n- 100 Wood (assumes 1:1 pair)\n- 100 Stone (assumes 1:1 pair)\n- 100 Dragonhide (assumes 1:1 pair)\n\n**exchange for:** \n\n300 $LORDS (minus any fees)\n```\n\nIf you need a specific amount of resources for an upgrade you could purchase all the resources in one transaction - saving time and fees!\n\n\n\n### Trading Fees\n\nTwo types of trading fees exist on the AMM. (These are subject to change)\n\n| Fee | % | Destination |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| LP Rewards | 1.5% | LP Providers |\n| $LORDS Commission | 1.5% | Nexus |\n\nimport Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\nimport TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n\n<Tabs>\n  <TabItem value=\"apple\" label=\"LP Rewards\" default>\nIf you are supplying liquidity to a resource pool you will be returned LP tokens for that pool. These tokens represent your share of the Pool. When removing your LP tokens you will have earned interest according to the fees on $LORDS generated within that pool. (This is similar to Sushiswaps LP pools and is not the same as Uniswap V3 pools)\n  </TabItem>\n  <TabItem value=\"orange\" label=\"$LORDS Commission\">\nAll trades will contain $LORDS as the opposite side of the trade. There is a commission on these $LORDS which will be set originally at 1.5%. This commission will be split into the Nexus and Treasury.\n  </TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n\n---\n\n## Liquidity in the AMM\n\n### Providing Liquidity \n\nWhen providing liquidity to AMM, you are returned LP tokens for that pool. As trading occurs, the LP position will accrue a portion of the fees, and as with any AMM, the pool may be subject to impermanent loss. We strongly recommend understanding the risks of impermanent loss before becoming an LP merchant.\n\n:::note\nLiquidity is supplied at the current price point in the x * y = k curve.\n:::\n\n### Staking your LP tokens for further rewards\n\nOnce you are in possession of LP tokens you can then become a Liquidity Merchant and stake your LP tokens for further rewards - learn how via [The Nexus](./nexus.md).",

For example, a Realm with only Wood can build a work hut for 75x Wood, while a Realm with Diamonds, Sapphire and Mithral will need to pay 75 of each.\n\nOnce you build work huts they will decay, so it is not a one-time purchase. Work huts decay over 3 days. Once they decay completely, your population will decrease until you rebuild them.\n\n### Military\n\nA Lord must build military buildings to unlock the ability to summon battalions for raiding Realms and defending their raidable vault.\n\nThere are four types of military buildings and they unlock different Battalions.\n\n| Building                                                            | Tier 1 Unit                                                            | Tier 2 Unit                                                     |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| ![Buildings](/img/game/buildings/mj_archery_range.png) Archer House | ![Buildings](/img/game/battalions/mj_longbow.png) Longbow              | ![Buildings](/img/game/battalions/mj_hunter.png) Hunter         |\n| ![Buildings](/img/game/buildings/mj_mage_tower.png) Mage Tower      | ![Buildings](/img/game/battalions/mj_apprentice.png) Apprentice        | ![Buildings](/img/game/battalions/mj_mage.png) Mage             |\n| ![Buildings](/img/game/buildings/mj_castle.png) Castle              | ![Buildings](/img/game/battalions/mj_scout.png) Scout                  | ![Buildings](/img/game/battalions/mj_knight.png) Knight         |\n| ![Buildings](/img/game/buildings/mj_barracks.png) Mage Tower        | ![Buildings](/img/game/battalions/mj_lightInfantry.png) Light Infantry | ![Buildings](/img/game/battalions/mj_heavyInfantry.png) Paladin |\n\n### Agricultural\n\n**Farms & Fishing Villages**\n\nTo keep a positive happiness level, a Realm Lord must ensure that there is enough food for the population at any given time. The higher the population (work huts) and military units on a Realm, the more food required to maintain happiness and therefore increase resource output.\n\nThere are two agricultural buildings in the Eternum and they produce two different food:\n\n| Building                                                                 | Food Output | # of harvests |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------- |\n| ![Buildings](/img/game/buildings/mj_farm.png) Farm                       | $WHEAT      | 24 Harvests   |\n| ![Buildings](/img/game/buildings/mj_fishing_village.png) Fishing Village | $FISH       | 24 Harvests   |\n\nEach building type allow you 24 harvests. However, you must harvest a maximum of 6 Harvests at anyone time. If you do not harvest, then your farms will decay over time and you will not be as productive as you can be.\n\n:::note\n$WHEAT and $FISH can be sold/purchased on the AMM\n:::\n\n**Storehouses**\n\nTo distribute food to your population and troops, you must convert $FISH/$WHEAT into a storehouse.\n\nStorehouses take up spatial areas on your Realm so you must be strategic about your buildings to ensure you always have enough room to feed your population, and therefore increase your resource output and troop's vitality.\n\nEach 10,000 units of food in a storehouse takes up 2 sqm on your Realm, this means you cannot just hoard food on your Realm otherwise you will not be able to build anything else.\n",

Buy it from the market or grow it.\n\n:::note\n\nIf you want to increase your resource production (population) or have a military to attack/defend (Battalions) with a higher vitality, you will need to provide your Realm with food. Food is cheap and every realm can produce (or purchase) it, but you must manage it wisely or suffer the consequences.\n\n:::\n\n## Rivers (Farms) & Harbors (Fishing Villages)\n\nFarms are constrained to the number of rivers you have in your Realm, and fish traps to your harbors. The higher number of farms/fish Traps you have built, the higher yield of wheat/fish you’ll generate.\nEach farm/fishing village generates 14,000 $WHEAT/$FISH per day.\n\n![WIP of a game asset](/img/game/buildings/mj_fishing_village.png)\n\n![WIP of a game asset](/img/game/buildings/mj_farm.png)\n\n## Feeding your population and troops\n\nOnce you have harvested or purchased $WHEAT/$FISH, you are able to distribute this food to your population and troops by converting the food into storehouses.\n\nUnlike farms and fish traps, storehouses take up space in your realms spatial area. The more storehouses you build, the more space they take up, but the longer they feed your population and troops. Storehouses deplete at a rate according to how many troops and population you have. The greater the standing army or buildings, the greater the consumption rate.\n\n---\n\n![Food Production](/img/game/food-production.png)\n\n---\n\n![WIP of a game asset](/img/game/buildings/mj_storehouse.png)\n\n## Trading excess food on the AMM\n\nOnce you harvest either $WHEAT/$FISH from your Farms/Fish Traps, you have the option to trade any excess on the AMM for $LORDS.\n\nIn turn, this provides the opportunity for other Lords to purchase them instead of having to build farms/traps and harvesting themselves. A Lord with low rivers/harbors with a penchant for raiding, or simply being time poor can benefit from this, while providing a $LORDS stream to productive farmers.\n\nWheat and fish will be traded separately, and utility related to net consumptions, will add an interesting economic factor to the game.\n\n## Factors to consider\n\n### Food consumption\n\nFood consumption is calculated by your population. Buildings and battalions count towards your population, the more you have, the faster your food is depleted.\n\nIf your Realm runs out of food, you will be permanently capped at 250 resource production and your armies will be at 50% health when they fight, drastically reducing your chances of success.\n",

    "pageContent": "# Generating Resources\n\n---\n\n> 22 resources of varying rarity have been discovered across the Realms, ranging from common Coal & Wood to the rare and magical Mithral & Dragonhide.\n\n---\n\n#### How are Resources generated?\n\nOnce a Realm is settled in the game, it becomes eligible to start generating resources. To begin generating resources, players must purchase Labor for each resource they want to produce. The cost of Labor varies for each resource, with rarer resources having a higher cost (priced in resources). This creates an economy where players must balance the resources they want to produce with the cost of production, giving them a sense of ownership and responsibility over the resources they produce.\n\nEach resource generation cycle takes 2 hours after purchasing Labor and yields 25x of the resource. Resources can be harvested at any time once they are available and are protected from raids, allowing players to harvest them at their own convenience.\n\n#### How do I increase Resource production?\n\nPlayers can purchase Labor in 2-hour increments. To generate more resources, players can buy multiple Labor and claim the resources every 2 hours or wait and claim the resources once the queued production is completed.\n\nFor example, if a player buys 10x Labor for Diamonds, they can claim 25x Diamonds every 2 hours for 10 times or claim 250x Diamonds 20 hours later.\n\n![Resource Production](/img/game/resource-production.png)\n\n#### How do I harvest Resources?\n\nResources are claimable after each 2-hour Labor cycle and will appear in the player's Iron Bank. These resources are tokens and can be traded on the Automated Market Maker (paired with $LORDS) and can be used to improve the Realm, trade with other players, or used to buy other resources.\n\n#### Resource accrual cap\n\nThere is no limit on how many Labor a player can purchase for each resource, however, players will have to claim them in 2-hour increments. \n\n#### What do Resources do?\n\nYou can use resources in order to construct [buildings](./buildings#economic), summon [battalions](./troops-squads), and trade on the [AMM](/docs/economics/resource-amm). They are the economic layer of this world and are scarce, so use them wisely.\n\n![Resource Production](/img/game/buildings/mj_castle.png)\n\n_A WIP of the Buildings_\n\n---\n\n## The Raidable Vault\n\nEvery Realm generates an additional stream of resources that are automatically accumulated in the Realm's vault. These resources are the target of raids and must be protected. Once the vault reaches 1008x units, it becomes claimable as a bonus. \n\nEvery time a player purchases 1x Labor for a resource, 25% of the claimable amount is added to the resource's vault for that Realm. Each resource of each Realm has its own unique vault. In case of a successful raid, the vault will be depleted by 25% each time, requiring the players to wait longer for the vault to refill before claiming the resources.\n\n### Defending your vault\n\nIn order to protect your vault and reach maximum production, it is important to build up a strong defensive army. This will help deter attacks and prevent damage to your vault, allowing it to reach its full potential. Without proper defense, your vault will be vulnerable to attacks and may never reach 1008 units of production.\n\n### Cool down between attacks\n\nIf you are attacked, whether successfully or not, your Realm is given a 2 hour cool down period where it can't be attacked.\n\n---\n\n## Trade resources\n\n#### The AMM\n\nResources are tradable for $LORDS via the AMM. If you have excess resources you can trade them for $LORDS to hold, or in turn, use to buy the resources you don't generate but need for other operations on your Realm.\n",

These extend beyond simply being able to share a PFP between games or trade one games' asset for another - but rather deeply integrated gaming experiences developed in a more decentralized fashion. The open nature of the blockchain allows developers to build on top of each other and integrate applications - leading to the emergence of standards encompassing concepts such as shared XP upgrades, physics and verifiable randomness. \n\n\n## Modules act as open source DLCs\nIndividual applications (such as developed at Bibliotheca) can take advantage on a more micro level by splitting monolithic codebases into functional modules that can be \"composed\" together. We split elements such as Settling, Resource Production, Building Construction, Realm Statistics, Wonders, AMM & Adventurers into logical modules that developers can reuse or modify and potentially be integrated back into the main game contract. For example - Crypts & Caverns has replicated the Settling & Resource modules, allowing the game assets to easily be integrated back into the main game logic and subsequently the user frontend client.\n![module controller](/img/game/module-controller.png)\nThe entirety of the game is controlled through a core module controller contract determing which contracts have write access to the game state and logic. All upgrades to the controller (such as adding a new building type or integrating another project) are governed by the Bibliotheca DAO. By creating this modular structure the game has the ability expand independent of the core team. A new developer could choose to write a module that interacted with the rest of the game, proposed it to the community, and on a successful vote the game expands. \n\n### Creators get paid\n\nThe verifiability of the blockchain allows us to simulate an 'app store' like experience for new developers. When a new developer writes a module, they could choose to bake in a micro transaction to use this contract, resulting in the developer being paid each time a player interacts with it. Alternatively creators may be rewarded by the DAO for providing new experiences.\n\n",

Recent advances in blockchain technology are allowing for orders of magnitude greater scalability and computation, greatly enhancing the viability of vibrant, feature rich gaming ecosystems. Developing the game state and logic on-chain provides a myriad of benefits and possibilities not explored in traditional game environments, such as interoperability with other ecosystems and shared, composable gaming experiences - made possible by the open, verifiable data provided by the chain.\n\n![Stack](/img/stack.png)\n\nThe [technology stack](./the-stack.md) includes languages such as Solidity, Cairo, React, GraphQL, Typescript to create all game state and logic on-chain, then cache it in a performant indexer which can be queried by any frontend application - such as the Atlas website or a developer creating an automated bot. The DAO provides opportunities for contribution from both within and external sources. If you'd like to learn more about how to contribute, get in contact on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/qjXNx4Htas) or [Github](https://github.com/BibliothecaForAdventurers/).\n\n## StarkNet\n[StarkNet](./starknet.md) is a revolutionary Ethereum L2, employing STARK validity proofs to deliver an unseen level of scalability and computation on top of the security of the L1 mainnet, at far lower costs. Features such as account abstraction, volitions and recursive scaling (L3) will provide a new paradigm of development allowing for complex gaming experiences to realise a more pure vision of the metaverse.\n\n## Module Architecture\nGame assets have been conceptualized to enable a [modular architecture](./module-architecture.md) - leaning in to the blockchain's enabling of the innovative creative space of composability. The separation of various components (e.g Combat System, Building Upgrades, Troops, Resources, Adventurers) enables a new paradigm of interoperability and upgradability. Elements such as the combat module can be extended or modified, e.g. adding some physics based interaction, or integrated with another on-chain games stack. Any party is able to propose a new module to the DAO to be officially adopted (and potentially earn a revenue stream), or permissionlessly create their own experience.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "pageContent": "# StarkNet & Validity Proofs\n---\n\nGames are some of the most complex pieces of software that exist in the world. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is an incredible tool for low power requirement software, however it is not suited for heavy computation (and was never designed for it). For true on-chain realities and worlds to emerge we require a new technology, and we believe that STARKS show the greatest promise to achieve this.\n\nStarkNet is a validity proof generalized smart contract network in which anyone can publish smart contracts. These smart contracts create tiny proofs which are validated by external machines. Once enough of these proofs have been created by the network a batch is published onto Ethereum Mainnet. This enables the heavy computation needed for games to be abstracted, while still retaining the security guarantee of a decentralized network, Ethereum.\n\n\n## STARKS\n\n### What is a STARKS\n\"ZK-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge) are a type of cryptographic proof technology that enables users to share validated data or perform computations with a third party without the data or computation being revealed to the third-party, also known as a zero-knowledge proof, in a way that is publicly verifiable. In simpler terms, a zero-knowledge proof can prove something is true without having to reveal what exactly it is proving. For example, ZK-STARKs would allow Alice to verify Bob's banking information using a zero-knowledge cryptographic proof instead of revealing the confidential information to Alice.\"\n\nhttps://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-starks/\n\n### What is StarkNet \nStarkNet is a permissionless decentralized Validity-Rollup (also known as a “ZK-Rollup”), operating as an L2 network over Ethereum. It enables greatly enhanced scaling for its computation –  without compromising Ethereum’s composability and security, thanks to StarkNet’s reliance on the safest and most scalable cryptographic proof system (STARKs). StarkNet has been developed by StarkWare Industries Ltd, the pioneers behind the StarkEx scalability engine.\n\n![StarkNet](/img/starknet.png)\n*Source:* StarkWare Industries\n\n### Scalable and computational \nSTARKs are able to improve the scalability of an L1 network by allowing developers to move computations and (in the future) storage off-chain. Off-chain services can generate STARK proofs that attest the integrity of off-chain computations. These proofs are then published on-chain for any interested party to validate the computation. In completing the bulk of computational work off-chain with STARKs, existing blockchain infrastructure can scale exponentially while still trustlessly maintaining computational integrity.\n\n### Cairo and a new way to write contracts\nSolidity has a number of limitations that make it inefficient for compiling STARKS, such as relying on more inefficient data structures (e.g uint256) and limited access to low-level primitives. Cairo is the first Turing-complete language for creating provable programs for general computation, enabling these limitations be bypassed. \n\n### Account Abstraction\nEthereum is limited to two types of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) and Contract Accounts (CA). User accounts - EOAs - are tied to a specific cryptographic signer, which must be used in order to execute transactions. StarkNet removes this limitation - and instead accounts are smart contracts that can define their own logic in how it interacts with the network. This provides exciting possibilites for gaming, such as guild account contracts and authenticating with session keys to open a secure game state that doesn't require constant signing of transactions. The potential of account abstraction will greatly enhance blockchain gaming as it is fully explored in the years to come. ",
